# Pacman

It's a pacman game.

The you might need to know is that the ghost's have a different way to chase pacman.
Red Ghost: Blinky's target is pacman's position.
Pink Ghost: Pinky's target is 4 cells in front of pacman. But when pacman's direction is up the the target is 4 cells in front of him and 4 cells to the left.
Blue Ghost: Inky's target like pinky but just 2 cells in front of him, but the catch is that he calculates a vector from the red ghost to Inky's target and then dubble that vector And there's the final target.
Orange Ghost: Clyde's target is pacman but when comes 8 tiles close to pacman he change his target to the bottom left corner a.k.a scatter mode.

That's what you need to know about the ghosts ;)
